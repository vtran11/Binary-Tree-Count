# Binary-Tree-Count (2015)
Given the recursive nature of a binary tree, a good strategy for writing a C++ function that operates on a binary tree is often first to write a recursive definition of the task. 
Task:
a) Computer the height of a tree. 
b) Find the sum of the elements.
c) Determine whether one item is an ancestor of another.
d) Determine the highest level that is full or, equivalently, has the maximum number of nodes for that level. 
e) Determine the deepest level that is full or, equivalently, has the maximum number of nodes for that level.
